# Infrastructure Automation with Gradle and Puppet

Slide deck of presentation "**Infrastructure Automation with Gradle and Puppet**" given at **GR8Conf US** (Minneapolis), *2015* by *Andrey Adamovich*.

Presentation description:

>  Infrastructure-as-code is becoming a mandatory part of any successful project. During this presentation we will show how to use Gradle plugins and Puppet manifests to provision and maintain consistent infrastructure configuration. We will also touch tools like Jenkins, Vagrant, Packer, VirtualBox and AWS. During last years we accumulated a lot of experience helping our clients automating their JVM projects starting from automated deployments and ending with fully automated production infrastructure configuration. I would like to share this experience in a workshop.
